GoogleAds
=========

google_ads is a simple plugin to help adding lots of google ads website and keep them maintained in one central location.

Updated to work with rails 2.3 and the latest google adsense javascript.

Example
=======

Install the plugin.

In config/initializers/ create a new initializer (I call it google_ads.rb) and you'll want to have something like the following in there:

Rubaidh::GoogleAds.defaults.merge!({
  # Google Adsense Identifier, looks something like 'pub-0123456789012345'
  :client => 'pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
})

# setup some basic advert sizes
leaderboard = {
  :width => 728,
  :height => 90,
}

small_square = {
  :width => 200,
  :height => 200
}

# Customise each different type of ad, specifying the ad_slot for each advert
Rubaidh::GoogleAds.ad_formats.merge!({
  :default_leaderboard => leaderboard.merge({
    :ad_slot => 'xxxxxxxxxx'
  }),
  :default_square => small_square.merge({
    :ad_slot => 'xxxxxxxxxx'
  })
})

# Want adverts to be displayed in development environment?
Rubaidh::GoogleAds.environments << 'development'

#####

And in the view, simply use:

<%= google_ad(:default_leaderboard) %>
<%= google_ad(:default_square) %>
